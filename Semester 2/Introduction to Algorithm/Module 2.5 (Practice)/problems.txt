Given a m x n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in grid.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
 

Follow up: Could you find an O(n + m) solution?

2089. Find Target Indices After Sorting Array
Easy

Companies
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a target element target.

A target index is an index i such that nums[i] == target.

Return a list of the target indices of nums after sorting nums in non-decreasing order. If there are no target indices, return an empty list. The returned list must be sorted in increasing order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 2
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
The indices where nums[i] == 2 are 1 and 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 3
Output: [3]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
The index where nums[i] == 3 is 3.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 5
Output: [4]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
The index where nums[i] == 5 is 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i], target <= 100


2529. Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer
Easy

Given an array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return the maximum between the number of positive integers and the number of negative integers.

In other words, if the number of positive integers in nums is pos and the number of negative integers is neg, then return the maximum of pos and neg.
Note that 0 is neither positive nor negative.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,-1,-1,1,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-3,-2,-1,0,0,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 2 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,20,66,1314]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 positive integers and 0 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2000
-2000 <= nums[i] <= 2000
nums is sorted in a non-decreasing order.



268. Missing Number
Easy

Companies
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

Companies
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.
