Problem Statement

You will be given an undirected graph where there will be N nodes and E edges. You need to tell the number of edges that can create a cycle in the graph.

Note: Duplicate edges as input can not be possible. The value of nodes are from 1 to N.

Input Format

First line will contain N and E.
Next E lines will contain A and B which means there is a edge between A and B.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= E <= (N*(N-1))/2
1 <= A, B <= N
Output Format

Output the number of edges that can create a cycle.

Problem Statement

You have just opened a dish cable business and you want to connect your dish lines in your area. In your area there are N buldings and E roads. The roads are two way obviously. In each road there is a cost of connecting the cables. You want to connect all buldings in such a way that there is connection from any building to another, not necessary to be directly.

As you are a businessman, you want the total cost to be minimum. Can you tell the minimum total cost to do the work?

Note: There can be multiple road from one building to another. If it is not possible to connect all the building, print -1.

Input Format

First line will contain N and E.
Next E lines will contain A, B and W which means there is a connection in between A and B where the cost for connecting the cable is W.
Constraints

1 <= N, E <= 10^5
1 <= A, B <= N
1 <= W <= 10^9
Output Format

Output the minimum cost.

Problem Statement

You will be given N numbers of nodes, E numbers of edges in a graph. For each edge you will be given A, B and W which means there is a connection from A to B for which you need to give W cost. The value of nodes could be from 1 to N.

You will be given a source node S. Then you will be given a test case T, for each test case you will be given a destination node D. You need to tell the minimum cost from source node to destination. If there is no possible path from S to D then print Not Possible.

Note: If there is a negative weight cycle in the graph, then no answer would be correct. So print one line only - "Negative Cycle Detected".

Input Format

First line will contain N and E.
Next E lines will contain A, B and W.
Next line will contain source node S.
Next line will contain T, the number of test cases.
For each test case, you will get D.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= E <= 1000
1 <= S <= N
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= D <= N
-10^9 <= W <= 10^9
Output Format

Output the minimum cost for each test case.

Problem Statement

You'll be given a graph of N nodes and E edges. For each edge, you'll be given A, B and W which means there is an edge from A to B which will cost W. Also, you'll be given Q queries, for each query you'll be given X and Y, where X is the source and Y is the destination. You need to print the minimum cost from A to B for each query. If there is no connection between X and Y, print -1.

Note: There can be multiple edges from one node to another.

Input Format

First line will contain N and E.
Next E lines will contain A, B and W.
After that you'll get Q.
Next Q queries will contain X and Y.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 100
1 <= E <= 10^5
1 <= A, B <= N
1 <= W <= 10^9
1 <= Q <= 10^5
1 <= X, Y <= N
Output Format

Output the minimum cost for each query.
