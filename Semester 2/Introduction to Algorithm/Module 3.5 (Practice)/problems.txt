912. Sort an Array

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
 

Constraints:

nums1.length == m + n
nums2.length == n
0 <= m, n <= 200
1 <= m + n <= 200
-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109

Sample Input 1 :
2
7
3 4 1 6 2 5 7
4
4 3 1 2
Sample Output 1 :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 2 3 4
Explanation For Sample Input 1:
Test Case 1 :

Given ‘ARR’ : { 3, 4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 7 }

Then sorted 'ARR' in non-descending order will be : { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }. Non-descending order means every element must be greater than or equal to the previse element.

Test Case 2 :

Given ‘ARR’ : { 4, 3, 1, 2 }

Then sorted 'ARR' in non-descending order will be : { 1, 2, 3, 4 }. 
Sample Input 2 :
2

2 1 1
Sample Output 2 :

Sample Input 1:
2
6
12 1 35 10 34 1
5
10 10 10 10 10
Sample Output 1:
34
-1
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
Test case 1: In the given sequence of numbers, number 35 is the largest element, followed by number 34 which is the second-largest element. Hence we return number 34 which is the second-largest element in the sequence.

Test case 2: In the given sequence of numbers, number 10 is the largest element. However, since all the elements are the same, the second largest element does not exist. So, we return -1.
Sample Input 2:
1
6
7 8 8 1 4 3 
Sample Output 2:
7
Explanation Of Sample Input 2:
In the given sequence of numbers, 8 exists two times and is the largest element, followed by 7 which is the second-largest element. Hence we return the number 7 as the second-largest element.
