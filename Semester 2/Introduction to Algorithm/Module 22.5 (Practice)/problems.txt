inputstandard input
outputstandard output
Given two numbers 𝑁
 ,𝑋
 and an array 𝐴
 of 𝑁
 numbers. Determine if there is a way to put '+' or '-' signs between every two numbers in the array 𝐴
 in order to make an expression that is equal to 𝑋
.

Note: Solve this problem using recursion.

Input
First line contains two numbers 𝑁
 and 𝑋
 (1≤𝑁≤20,−109≤𝑋≤109)
.

Second line contains 𝑁
 distinct numbers 𝐴1,𝐴2,....𝐴𝑁
 (1≤𝐴𝑖≤105)
.

Output
Print "YES" if you can put '+' or '-' signs between every two number to create an expression that is equal to 𝑋
 otherwise, print "NO".

Examples

5 5
1 2 3 4 5

NO
Note
In the first example: 1 - 2 - 3 + 4 + 5 = 5

outputstandard output
Given a number 𝑁
. Initially you have a value equal 1 and you can perform one of the following operation any number of times:

Multiply your current value by 10.
Multiply your current value by 20.
Determine if your value can reach 𝑁
 or not.

Note: Solve this problem using recursion.

Input
First line contains a number 𝑇
 (1≤𝑇≤100)
 number of test cases.

Next 𝑇
 lines will contain a number 𝑁
 (1≤𝑁≤1012)
.

Output
For each test case print "YES" if your value can reach exactly 𝑁
 otherwise, print "NO".
