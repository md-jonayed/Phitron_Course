Problem Statement

Once upon a time, there was a treasure hunter who ventured into an ancient temple in search of a valuable artifact. The temple was filled with traps and obstacles, and the treasure hunter had to carry all of his equipment with him.

The treasure hunter had a backpack with a limited weight capacity, and he could only carry a certain amount of equipment with him. Each piece of equipment had its own weight and value, and the treasure hunter needed to choose which items to bring to maximize the total value while keeping the total weight under the limit.

Help the treasure hunter to choose which items to bring in his backpack to maximize their total value while keeping the total weight of his backpack under a certain limit. Each item can only be included once.

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case will contain N(Number of items) and W(Total weight of backpack).
Second line of each test case will contain an array w containing the weights of all items.
Third line of each test case will contain an array v containting the values of all items.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 1000
0 <= W <= 1000
0 <= w[i] <= 1000; Here 0 <= i < N
0 <= v[i] <= 1000; Here 0 <= i < N
Output Format

Output the maximum total value you can obtain in the backpack for each test case.

In each step you can choose one of the following:

Add 3 with the current value
Multiply by 2 with the current value
Can you tell if you can reach N by using any number of steps you want.

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases.
In each test case you will be given N.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 10^5

Rahim and Karim are two brothers. They wanted to give a lot of chocolates to their mom. Their mom brought N boxes of chocolates for them. However, in each box, the number of chocolates is not the same, and their mom didn't know it. Now she is very upset because her children want the whole box, and they also want an equal number of chocolates. So she needs your help.

Can you tell if she could divide those boxes between her children so that both of them get an equal number of chocolates? She can't throw away any boxes, and one box can be taken once.

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases.
First line of each test case will contain N.
Second line will contain a list A, the number of chocolates in each box.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= A[i] <= 1000; 0 <= i < N; Sum of all numbers won't exceed 2000
Output Format

Output "YES" if she could divide chocolates into her children, "NO" otherwise.

Can you tell if he can select marks from this list in such a way that his total marks add up to 1000?

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases.
First line of each test case will contain N and M.
Second line of each test case will contain a list A of N marks.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N, M <= 1000
1 <= A[i] <= 100; 0 <= i < N
