Problem Statement

Zarif has received M marks in his final term exam out of 1000. However, he wishes to obtain a perfect score of 1000 marks just once in his life. His wish was granted by a fairy who provided him with a list of N marks to choose from. Zarif needs to select any number of marks from that list, and he can choose each mark any number of times he wants.

Can you tell if he can select marks from this list in such a way that his total marks add up to 1000?

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases.
First line of each test case will contain N and M.
Second line of each test case will contain a list A of N marks.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 1000
0 <= M <= 1000
1 <= A[i] <= 100; 0 <= i < N
Output Format

Output "YES" if he can obtain perfect score of 1000, "NO" otherwise.

Problem Statement

Zarif has received M marks in his final term exam out of 1000. However, he wishes to obtain a perfect score of 1000 marks just once in his life. His wish was granted by a fairy who provided him with a list of N marks to choose from. Zarif needs to select any number of marks from that list, and he can choose each mark any number of times he wants. Fairy asked him how many ways he can do this. She wanted Zarif to answer the maximum ways he can choose those marks.

Can you tell what will be the maximum number of ways to choose those marks to fulfill his dream?

Note: As the answer can be very long, whenever the answer gets bigger than 1e9+7, mod it with 1e9+7.

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases.
First line of each test case will contain N and M.
Second line of each test case will contain a list A of N marks.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000

Problem Statement

Mina and Rita were playing with their dolls. Both of them had given names to their dolls. Now, they want to create a nameplate to attach to their dog's collar. However, their father told them he can only provide money for one nameplate. So, they need to create a single nameplate that includes both of their doll's names while keeping it as short as possible due to the character limit.

Can you help them choose a name that incorporates both of their doll's names and is as short as possible?

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases.
Each line of the test case will contain two strings A and B which are the name of the dolls.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= |A|, |B| <= 1000; Here |A| and |B| means the length of A and B. The string will contain small English alphabets only and won't contain any spaces.
Output Format

Print the number of character in that name which can be printed on the name plate.

Problem Statement

Rahim, fueled by his newfound fascination with strings and the enigmatic world of palindromes, has a challenging quest in mind. He's got a string swirling around in his thoughts, but the catch is, he's not entirely sure how palindromes work! Nevertheless, he's determined to transform his string into a glorious palindrome, and he's on a mission to do it in the quickest time possible.

Now, here's the deal: Rahim can add characters to his string at any position, but it comes at the price of one minute per character. Rahim, being the savvy time-saver he is, doesn't want to squander precious minutes. That's where you come in!

Your task is to help Rahim figure out the minimum time it will take to turn his string into a palindrome. Imagine the clock ticking and Rahim eagerly awaiting your genius advice. Let's embark on this palindromic journey and make it as swift and fascinating as possible!

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases.
Each line of the test case will contain the string S.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= |S| <= 1000; Here |S| means the length of S. The string will contain only English alphabets and won't contain any spaces.
Output Format

Output the minimum time needed to make the string palindrome.
