You are given the root of a binary tree that consists of exactly 3 nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child.

Return true if the value of the root is equal to the sum of the values of its two children, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [10,4,6]
Output: true
Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 10, 4, and 6, respectively.
10 is equal to 4 + 6, so we return true.
Example 2:


Input: root = [5,3,1]
Output: false
Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 5, 3, and 1, respectively.
5 is not equal to 3 + 1, so we return false.
 

Constraints:

The tree consists only of the root, its left child, and its right child.
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

A binary tree is uni-valued if every node in the tree has the same value.

Given the root of a binary tree, return true if the given tree is uni-valued, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,1,1,1,1,null,1]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: root = [2,2,2,5,2]
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val < 100

872. Leaf-Similar Trees

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.



For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

 

Example 1:


Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range [1, 200].
Both of the given trees will have values in the range [0, 200].

100. Same Tree
Easy

Companies
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 

Example 1:


Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
Example 3:


Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104


563. Binary Tree Tilt
Easy
2.1K
2.1K
Companies
Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's tilt.

The tilt of a tree node is the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and all right subtree node values. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node values is treated as 0. The rule is similar if the node does not have a right child.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
Example 2:


Input: root = [4,2,9,3,5,null,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)
Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 7)
Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5, and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
Example 3:


Input: root = [21,7,14,1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 9
