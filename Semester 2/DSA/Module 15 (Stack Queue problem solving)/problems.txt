Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
Example 2:

Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
Example 3:

Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200
s and t only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1 :
2
3 8
4 3 2
4 5
6 2 4 9
Sample Output 1 :
8 4 3 2
5 6 2 4 9
Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
Test Case 1:

We are  given 'MY_STACK = [4,3,2] and 'X’ = 8.
We insert ‘X’ at the bottom of ‘MY_STACK’. 
So finally, we have 'MY_STACK' = [8, 4, 3, 2]. 

Test Case 2:
After inserting an element at its bottom, the stack will be 5 6 2 4 9
Sample Input 2 :
2
1 0
4 
2 5
1 9
Sample Output 2 :
0 4
5 1 9
Explanation For Sample Input 2 :
Test Case 1:
We are given 'MY_STACK = [4]’ and 'X’ = 0’.
We insert ‘X’ at the bottom of ‘MY_STACK’. 
So finally, 'MY_STACK' will become [0, 4]. 

Test Case 2:
We are given 'MY_STACK = [1,9]’ and 'X’ = 5.
So finally, 'MY_STACK' will become [5, 1, 9].

1
9
5
10 6 8 12 3
Sample Output 1:
9 
3 12 8 6 10
Explanation 1:
For the first test case, the queue has only one element, i.e. 9. So, even after reversing, our queue remains the same.

For the second test case, the queue has elements in the order: 10, 6, 8, 12, 3. Reversing the queue changes the order of elements to - 3, 12, 8, 6, 10.
Sample Input 2:
2
2
99 89

1 2 3 4 5 6
Sample Output 2:
89 99
