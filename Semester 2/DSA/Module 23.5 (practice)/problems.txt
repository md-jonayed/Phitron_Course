Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100

Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.
A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node.
If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

Implement the MyLinkedList class:

MyLinkedList() Initializes the MyLinkedList object.
int get(int index) Get the value of the indexth node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
void addAtHead(int val) Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
void addAtTail(int val) Append a node of value val as the last element of the linked list.
void addAtIndex(int index, int val) Add a node of value val before the indexth node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
void deleteAtIndex(int index) Delete the indexth node in the linked list, if the index is valid.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MyLinkedList", "addAtHead", "addAtTail", "addAtIndex", "get", "deleteAtIndex", "get"]
[[], [1], [3], [1, 2], [1], [1], [1]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, 2, null, 3]

Explanation
MyLinkedList myLinkedList = new MyLinkedList();
myLinkedList.addAtHead(1);
myLinkedList.addAtTail(3);
myLinkedList.addAtIndex(1, 2);    // linked list becomes 1->2->3
myLinkedList.get(1);              // return 2
myLinkedList.deleteAtIndex(1);    // now the linked list is 1->3
myLinkedList.get(1);              // return 3
 

Constraints:

0 <= index, val <= 1000
Please do not use the built-in LinkedList library.
At most 2000 calls will be made to get, addAtHead, addAtTail, addAtIndex and deleteAtIndex.

Sample Output 1 :
17
23
11
-1
Explanation For Sample Output 1 :
The first three queries are of enQueue, so we will push 17, 23, and 11 into the queue.

The next four queries are of deQueue, so we will starting removing elements from the queue, so the first element will be 17, then 23, and then 11. And after the third dequeue query, the queue is now empty so for the fourth query, we will return -1.
Sample Input 2 :

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a 0-indexed integer array answer where:

answer.length == nums.length.
answer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|.
Where:

leftSum[i] is the sum of elements to the left of the index i in the array nums. If there is no such element, leftSum[i] = 0.
rightSum[i] is the sum of elements to the right of the index i in the array nums. If there is no such element, rightSum[i] = 0.
Return the array answer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,4,8,3]
Output: [15,1,11,22]
Explanation: The array leftSum is [0,10,14,22] and the array rightSum is [15,11,3,0].
The array answer is [|0 - 15|,|10 - 11|,|14 - 3|,|22 - 0|] = [15,1,11,22].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: [0]
Explanation: The array leftSum is [0] and the array rightSum is [0].
The array answer is [|0 - 0|] = [0].
