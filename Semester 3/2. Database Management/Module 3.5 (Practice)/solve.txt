1. ans : difference between data and information:
data is some unorganized values but information is collection of  organized data which bears some meaning.

2. primary key :
this kind of key helps  uniquely identify a record from a database.
e.g roll can be a primary key for a student table in a database.

composit primary key :
a composit primary key consist of 2 or more column values of a table in a database.
e.g 
-> course table
course_code       course_name         offered_by
cse 101            intro to c         UAP
cse 102            intro to java      BUET

here if we combine course code and course name we can build a composit primary key
primary key (course_code,course_name)

foreign key :
if we use one table's primary key in another table than it would be called foreign key.
suppose if we use roll the primary key of student table in a table called library then the roll will be called foreign key interms of library table.

3. ans : creating a table

use phitron;
create table employee(
    id char(4) primary key,
    name varchar(20) not null,
    salary float     not null,
    joining_date date

);

# inserted 2 employee details :

insert into employee
(id,name,salary,joining_date) values ('1234','Jonayed',25000, '2023-10-19');

insert into employee
(id,name,salary,joining_date) values ('1245','Mohammad',10000000,'2023-10-18');

# delete query:
in order to dlete we need to disable the safety feature first
set sql_safe_updates = 0              (to off safety feature)

delete from employee
where id = '1234';

set sql_safe_updates = 1              (to on safety feature)


q1 :

using phitron;

create table stuff(
    empId char(4) primary key,
    empName varchar(20) not null,
    joingYear int,
    birthday  date check (year(birthday) <= 2000),
    designation varchar(20) not null,
    salary float check(salary>0)
);

q2. How to make composite primary key constraint? Show with example.
create table student(
    id char(4),
    name varchar(20) not null,
    class int,
    primary key(id,name)
);

q3: Can LIMIT+OFFSET features can be done using only LIMIT Syntax? How?
yes it can be done:
for example, suppose there are 100 players in a sports club, if we want to see whose are listed in that club from 60 to 80 number we can run this query

select name
from club
limit 10
offset 59

or 
select name
from club limit(59,10)
