In MySQL, the Update and Delete query wasn’t executing, what was the reason and how to run those query? Write the code to enable the feature. (If you followed the class, you should know this).

ans : in MySQL update and delete query is by default is prohibited for execution for protection as well as security purpose. So, we need to use a certain command to enable this feature which is “set sql_safe_updates” to determine if the system would check unsafe operations.
‘Set sql_safe_updates = 0’ indicates that the system would not check unsafe operations.
‘Set sql_safe_updates = 1’ indicates that the system would check unsafe operations like ‘update’ and ‘delete’.
