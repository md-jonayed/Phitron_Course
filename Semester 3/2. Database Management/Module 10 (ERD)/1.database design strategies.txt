database design can be 2 types:
1. top down
2. bottom up

# top down :
here we first design the model then insert data into those models.
e.g- a database for hopital , a hospital can have doctors,nurse,patient,medicine etc table, we will first design those tables then we will insert data under those tables.

# bottom up :
here we first takes data then according to those data we create  models to store those data.
bottom up approach is needed for when there is an existing database.

# in order to design a database we will first perform requirement analysis

# what to avoid:
1. redundancy
same attribude should not be in multiple tables. except foreign key
2. incompleteness
data should be in both tables
