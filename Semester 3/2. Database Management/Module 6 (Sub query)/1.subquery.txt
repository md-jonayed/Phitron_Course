subquery is more like query within a query

eg. get salaries of employees where each employees salary is higher than 'abc'

select *
from employees
where salary >              -------------------  select salary
                                                 from employees
                                                 where name = 'abc';

we can use subquery-
select(subquery)
from (subquery)
where (subquery)
