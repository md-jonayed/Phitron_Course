for making connection between two table we use foreign key
e.g
create table student(
    roll varchar(5) primary key,
    name varchar(20) not null,
    phone varchar(11) not null
);

create table courses(
    course_name varchar(50) primary key,
    f_roll varchar(5),
    foreign key(f_roll) references student(roll)
);

foreign key on delete operation : 
it is used to delete a certain data which is use in several tables:
on delete cascade

if we want to delete a student's information from one table and his or her's informations on other table will be replaced as null then we will use:
on delete set null

e.g :

create table student(
    roll varchar(5) primary key,
    name varchar(50) not null
);

create table course(
    course_no int primary key,
    course_name varchar(20)
);

create table enroll(
    roll varchar(5),
    course_no int,
    date date,
    foreign key (roll) references student(roll)
    on delete cascade,
    foreign key(course_no) references course(course_no)
    on delete set null
);
