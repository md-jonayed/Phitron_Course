Given a balanced string 𝑆
 consists of ['R', 'L'] characters. Split it into maximum number of strings such that the new strings are also balanced.

Note:

Balanced strings are those who have equal quantities of 'L' and 'R' characters.
You can not remove or reorder the characters while making the new strings.
Input
Only one line contains a string 𝑆
 (2≤|𝑆|≤1000)
 where |S| is the length of the string.

It's guaranteed that 𝑆
 consists of only ['L', 'R'] letters, 𝑆
 is balanced and |𝑆|
 is even.

Output
Print maximum number of balanced strings then the balanced strings in any order.

Problem Statement
You are given a sequence of positive integers of length 
N, 
a=(a 
1
​
 ,a 
2
​
 ,...,a 
N
​
 ). Your objective is to remove some of the elements in 
a so that 
a will be a good sequence.

Here, an sequence 
b is a good sequence when the following condition holds true:

For each element 
x in 
b, the value 
x occurs exactly 
x times in 
b.
For example, 
(3,3,3), 
(4,2,4,1,4,2,4) and 
() (an empty sequence) are good sequences, while 
(3,3,3,3) and 
(2,4,1,4,2) are not.

Find the minimum number of elements that needs to be removed so that 
a will be a good sequence.
