<h1><u>- Discuss the scope of `var`, `let`, and `const`</u></h1>
<h2>Ans : var type variables are accessed and reinitialized from within a function. It has no effect of scope. <br>
    <br>
let type variables solves the above mentiond issues of the var keyword, let are block scoped and can't be accessed outside of the block. but we can reassign value if we declare a variable using let. <br>
<br>
const keyword  is used to declare constant tyoe variables which value can not be reassigned and it is also block scoped and can't be accessed outside of the scope. <br>
<br>
