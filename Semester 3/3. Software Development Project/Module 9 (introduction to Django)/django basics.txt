C--> Create (post)
R--> Retrive (get)
U--> Update

in frontend we use HTML,CSS,Javascript
backend we will use django

frontend+backend=Full system.(software development)

frontend__request --> URLS --> views --> views__response --> frontend.

django uses MVT Model View template.

first we search url --> url goes to views --> views goes to mode/databases --> then database gives response to views --> then view sends data to template --> then template rendered by views --> then view sends the template to the user.

# view is known as request handler returns relevant templates nd contents. 
# templete -> it presents how data should be presented to the application users. template consists of HTML,CSS,Javascript,Dango template language.

# django has an admin interface which can be used for handling all features from backend.
