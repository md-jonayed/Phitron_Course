Problem Statement

Tiger and Pathan are bored with movies and want to play a game. They will play the game in N round. Each time, both of them will guess a number X1 and X2, and whoever guesses the larger number will win that round. The final winner will be the one who wins the most rounds. In the event that they both win an equal number of times, the game will end in a draw.

Input Format

First line will contain N, the number of rounds.
Next N lines will contain two numbers X1 and X2, guessed by Tiger and Pathan respectively.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000
-10^9 <= X1, X2 <= 10^9
Output Format

Output "Tiger" if Tiger wins, "Pathan" if Pathan wins. If it is a draw, print "Draw" without the quotation marks.

Problem Statement

There are N army people standing in a line. Their major ordered them to make a line in asceding order according to their age. And then the major called the person stading in the middle. If there are two people in the middle then he will call both of them. Can you tell the age of the middle man or men?

Note: If N is odd then the middle person will be (N+1)/2 otherwise there will be two person in the middle, and they are (N/2) and (N/2)+1.

Input Format

First line will contain N, the number of army people.
Second line will contain N number which are the ages of those people.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 100
0 <= Age <= 1000
Output Format

Output the age or ages of the middle man or men.
