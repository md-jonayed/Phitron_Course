outputstandard output
Given a comparison symbol S between two numbers A and B. Determine whether it is Right or Wrong.

The comparison is as follows: A < B, A > B, A = B.

Where A, B are two integer numbers and S refers to the sign between them.

Input
Only one line containing A, S and B respectively (-100  ≤  A, B  ≤  100), S can be ('<', '>','=') without the quotes.

Output
Print "Right" if the comparison is true, "Wrong" otherwise.

Examples

Given a mathematical expression. The expression will be one of the following expressions:

A + B = C, A - B = C and A * B = C

where A, B, C are three numbers, S is the sign between A and B, and Q the '=' sign

Print "Yes" If the expression is Right , Otherwise print the right answer of the expression.

Input
Only one line containing the expression: A, S, B, Q, C respectively (0 ≤ A, B ≤ 100,  - 105 ≤ C ≤ 105) and S can be ('+', '-', '*') without the quotation.

Output
Output either "Yes" (without the quotation) or the right answer depending on the statement.

Given a number 𝑁 and an array 𝐴 of 𝑁 numbers. Determine if it's palindrome or not.

Note:

An array is called palindrome if it reads the same backward and forward, for example, arrays { 1 } and { 1,2,3,2,1 } are palindromes, while arrays { 1,12 } and { 4,7,5,4 } are not.

Input
First line contains a number 𝑁 (1≤𝑁≤105) number of elements.

Second line contains 𝑁 numbers (1≤𝐴𝑖≤109).

Output
Print "YES" (without quotes) if A is a palindrome array, otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

Examples

5
1 3 2 3 1
outputCopy
YES

4
1 2 3 4
outputCopy
NO

I. Smallest Pair

outputstandard output
Given a number N and an array A of N numbers. Print the smallest possible result of Ai + Aj + j - i , where 1  ≤  i < j  ≤  N.

Input
The first line contains a number T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) number of test cases.

Each test case contains two lines:

The first line consists a number N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100) number of elements.
The second line contains N numbers ( - 106 ≤ Ai ≤ 106).
Output
For each test case print a single line contains the smallest possible sum for the corresponding test case.

Example
inputCopy
1
4
20 1 9 4
outputCopy
7
Note
First Case :

All possibles (i,j) where (1  ≤  i < j  ≤  N) are :

i = 1 , j = 2 then result = a1 + a2 + j - i = 20 + 1 + 2-1 = 22.

i = 1 , j = 3 then result = a1 + a3 + j - i = 20 + 9 + 3-1 = 31.

i = 1 , j = 4 then result = a1 + a4 + j - i = 20 + 4 + 4-1 = 27.

i = 2 , j = 3 then result = a2 + a3 + j - i = 1 + 9 + 3-2 = 11.

i = 2 , j = 4 then result = a2 + a4 + j - i = 1 + 4 + 4-2 = 7.

i = 3 , j = 4 then result = a3 + a4 + j - i = 9 + 4 + 4-3 = 14.

So the smallest possible result is 7.

question: Create three static objects with the help of the constructor of the following class.Student{name;roll;section;math_marks;cls;}Then compare those 3 objects and print who got the highest math_marks and print his/her name.


question: Create a dynamic object named dhoni of the following class. Don%E2%80%99t use a constructor here, that means you need to fill the data by yourself.Cricketer{jersey_no;country;}Then make another dynamic object named kohli and copy the data of the dhoni object to kohli and after that delete the dhoni object. Then print the jersey_no and country of kohli object.Note: At first try to do this, kohli=dhoni and see if it gives the correct output. If not, then think deeply why it didn%E2%80%99t work and try to copy the data manually like kohli->jersey_no=dhoni->jersey_no;
