Problem Statement

Sakib threw a party in his house to celebrate his birthday. He told his friends a dress code to wear, the dress code is to wear even unique pearls in his/her dress, where each pearl will have a code written on it. Unfortunately there was a thief planning to rob the house. The thief knew about the dress code, but he didn't know the exact number of pearls they needed to wear. So the thief wears an odd number of pearls in his dress.

You have N numbers where each number represents a pearl code, you need to detect the code of the thief's pearl so that you can detect the thief.

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases.
First line of each test case will contain an positive integer N which is an odd number.
Second line of each test case will contain N integer values representing pearl code.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^4
-10^9 <= code <= 10^9
Output Format

Output the code of the thief's pearl.

Problem Statement:

Amena has just learned alphabets. She can read write from a to z only in lowercase. But, Amena always writes in alphabetic order what she saw. Also she writes a line as a word. For example, she writes monkey as ekmnoy. Her mother wants to test her reading and writing skills. Her mother gave her some lines, can you tell what she will write?

Note: Input will be given by EOF.

Input Format

Input consist of a line S. The line will contain lowercase letters and spaces. It is possible that there are multiple spaces together and the line end with spaces.
Constraints

Problem Statement

Qahadi is playing with numbers. He loves unique numbers and wants them a lot. He has some numbers, and it is possible that there are some duplicates. So, he wants to remove those duplicate numbers.

In a move he can remove a number that is currently in the list more than once. Can you tell how many moves does he need to make all the numbers unique.

For example,

If Qahadi had the numbers 1, 5, 10, 5, 2, 5, 10, 5, 1; then he will need 5 moves to remove 1, 5, 5, 5, 10 from the list and make the list: 1, 5, 10, 2 where all of the values are unique.

Input Format

First line will contain T, the number of test cases.
First line of each test case will contain N, the size of the list.
Second line of each test case will contain the list A of size N.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 100
1<= N <= 10^4
-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9 ; Here A[i] means the values of the list.
Output Format

Output how many moves does he need to make the list unique.

Dracula and Blood locked

Problem Statement

Once two draculas named Zaza and Kaza went to a hospital to drink blood. There were some bottles of blood arranged in a shelf like a binary string (a binary string is a string such that each character in it is either 0 or 1). If the character is 1, that means there is blood in that bottle else not. Zaza will first start drinking, then Kaza and then again Zaza, and so on.

During eating, at a time they can choose any number of consecutive bottles with the same type, after drinking it will be removed from the list.

For example: If the binary string is 0110111, then the optimal way will be,

Zaza will drink- 0110 111 and the string becomes 0110
Kaza will drink- 0 11 0 and the string becomes 00
After that, there is no bottle with blood to drink and they left the hospital. So, Zaza drank 3 bottles, and Kaza drank 2 bottles. Each of them wants to drink more bottles of blood. Can you calculate how many bottles of blood did Zaza drank?

Input Format

First line will contain an integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case will contain a binary string S.
Constraints

T (1 <= T <= 100)
S (1 <= |S| <= 100), here |S| means the length of S.
Output Format

For each test case, output a single line - number of bottles of milk Zaza drank.

Convert It locked

Problem Statement

Yunus Ali is working with binary trees. But he is not loving the order of the tree, he wants to optimize it so that he can do some operation easily. For this reason, he is converting the binary tree into something like that when taking out from the tree the value will be sorted and also he can put new values into that tree.

You will be given an initial binary tree in level order. After that you need to do Q operations on it. Any operation is of two types

Insert a value in that tree.
Delete the maximum value from that tree and print it.
It is guranteed that, there will be minimum one type 2 operation.

Input Format

You will be given the initial binary tree in level order, if the value is -1 that means there is no node.
Next line will contain Q, the number of operations
Next Q lines will contain the operations. The type will be either 1 or 2.
Constraints

V (0 <= V <= 100), value of a node.
0 < Q <= 100
Output Format

Output for type 2 operation

First operation will print the maximum value from the tree which is 4. After that next two operation inserted 10 and 8 in the tree. So the next type 2 operation will print 10 as the maximum value in the tree is 10.

Problem Statement

You have given a string that will be contain a-z, 1-9, '+', '-', '*', '/'.

The string contains some statements (at least one). A statement is defined as -

NC (Here N is defined as a number from 1-9, and C is defined as a group of small alphabets)
There will be an operator (+,-,*,/) between two statements
You have to apply the below rules on that string.

The Rules is,

Append the group of alphabets (C) N times to the final string.
Append the operators (if any) after the statements to the final string.
Suppose the string is 5a+2bc-9abc*1d

After apply,

5a wil become aaaaa
2bc will become bcbc
9abc become abcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabc
1d will become d
Finally the string will be like this after apply the string rules,

aaaaa+bcbc-abcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabc*d

Input Format

You will be given a string S in the given format.
Constraints

2 <= |S| <= 5000 ; Here |S| mean the length of the String
Output Format

Print the final string after applying the rules.
