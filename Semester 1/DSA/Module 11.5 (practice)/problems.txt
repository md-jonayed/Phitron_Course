Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 50
0 <= val <= 50

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz
 

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer k.

Return the head of the linked list after swapping the values of the kth node from the beginning and the kth node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
Output: [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is n.
1 <= k <= n <= 105
0 <= Node.val <= 100

2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros

Companies
You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have Node.val == 0.

For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.

Return the head of the modified linked list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
Output: [4,11]
Explanation: 
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.
Example 2:


Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
Output: [1,3,4]
Explanation: 
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
- The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [3, 2 * 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 1000
There are no two consecutive nodes with Node.val == 0.
The beginning and end of the linked list have Node.val == 0.
